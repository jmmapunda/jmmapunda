John,

Web Developer | Python Programmer | Freelancer

I am a skilled web developer and programmer with a strong foundation in Python, Flask, and web technologies. Over the time, I have honed my expertise in creating dynamic, responsive websites and applications, specializing in API integration, automation, and data-driven solutions. My work reflects a passion for combining functionality with creativity to deliver exceptional user experiences.

Key projects I’ve worked on include:
	•	Movie Site Application: A Flask-based web application showcasing the top ten movies, complete with dynamic ranking and styling powered by CSS and Bootstrap.
	•	LinkedIn Automation: Automated workflows for streamlined professional networking using Python and Api.

Beyond technical skills, I have a deep understanding of deployment processes, including hosting Flask apps on platforms like Render, and implementing secure and scalable database solutions.

As a lifelong learner, I continuously expand my knowledge by exploring new technologies and tools, such as Pandas for advanced data analysis, BeautifulSoup for web scraping, and advanced CSS for custom designs. I am also exploring freelancing opportunities, particularly on platforms like Contra, to collaborate on innovative projects.

Whether building applications from scratch or enhancing existing systems, I bring dedication, problem-solving, and a user-focused approach to every project. My goal is to create impactful digital solutions that align with client needs and industry standards.
